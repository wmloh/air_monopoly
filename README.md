A simple game that simulates running an airline company

Author's note:

This is the first project that I started but was unfortunately unable to complete it due to time constraints and lack of knowledge
in solving some problem. For example, I stopped at developing a price and revenue model as I needed to understand adopt an economic model
that takes into account product differentiation as well as a mathematical equation to connect marginal revenue and marginal cost with
constants. Furthermore, to complete this project, I needed to develop some sort of AI to take on the role as competitors which will be
incredible difficult. So, I plan to stop this project. 

However, developing games is my passion since young, when I chanced upon Warcraft World Editor. I intend to continue to pursue my passion
when I have acquired the necessary skils.

A turn-based strategy game that puts you in the shoes of the CEO of an airline company! Put your strategy to test and see the outcome.
Should you buy massive but expensive passenger jets, or perhaps many cheap but short-ranged ones? How aggressive should you be with 
your marketing operations? These are all the questions that will be answered as you venture into this simulation.
